# ***Overview***
This project presents an interactive Excel Dashboard for analyzing coffee sales data. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance using charts, pivot tables, and key performance metrics.

# ***Dataset***

The Excel file consists of the following key sheets:
- Orders : Contains all sales transactions, including customer details, product information, and revenue.
- Customers : Stores customer information such as contact details, country, and loyalty program status.
- Products : Lists coffee products with pricing, roast types, and profitability.
- Dashboard & Charts : Provides visual insights into sales trends and key metrics.

# ***Key Insights***

### *Top-Selling Coffee Type* : 
- Excelsa leads in sales volume, not Arabica as initially suggested. For instance, Excelsa peaks at $681.07 in April 2019, and its consistent high sales (e.g., $541.73 in May 2020) outpace Arabica’s more variable performance (e.g., $840.93 in Sep 2021 but $53.66 in May 2019).

### *Best Customer Segment* : 
- Loyalty cardholders contribute significantly to revenue. Approximately 43% of transactions in the sample (50 out of 116) involve loyalty cards, and top customers like Allis Wilmore ($317.07) are likely tied to this segment, reinforcing its value.

### *Sales Distribution by Country* :
- The United States accounts for 81% of total sales ($35,638.88), followed by Ireland at 15% ($6,696.86), and the United Kingdom at 4% ($2,798.51). These are the key markets driving revenue.

### *Most Profitable Product* :
- Larger packs (2.5kg) yield the highest profits per unit, with Liberica Light 2.5kg at $4.74 profit per sale, compared to smaller sizes like Arabica Dark 0.2kg at $0.27.

### *Customer Preferences* :
- Medium roast appears frequently in transactions (e.g., 44 out of 116 sample orders), suggesting it’s a preferred choice over Light or Dark roasts, though specific sales totals per roast type weren’t aggregated in the summary data.

# ***Recommendations***

### *Customer Retention* : 
- Enhance loyalty program benefits to drive repeat purchases. With 43% of transactions linked to loyalty cardholders and significant revenue from repeat customers (e.g., Allis Wilmore), offering discounts or exclusive perks could boost retention further.

### *Profit Optimization* : 
- Promote larger coffee packs (e.g., 2.5kg sizes) to maximize per-transaction profits. Liberica Light 2.5kg’s $4.74 profit far exceeds smaller packs, making it a prime candidate for bundling or promotional focus.

### *Geographic Expansion* : 
- Intensify marketing efforts in the U.S. and Ireland, which together account for 96% of sales ($42,335.75 of $45,134.25). Targeted campaigns in these high-sales regions could amplify revenue.

### *Seasonal Trends* : 
- Analyze data for peak sales months (e.g., September and October 2021 with $840.93 Ara and $584.64 Lib) to optimize stock levels and pricing. Preemptive inventory planning for these periods could capitalize on demand surges.

# *Conclusion*

This coffee sales dashboard reveals Excelsa as the top seller (e.g., $681.07 in Apr 2019), with 2.5kg Liberica Light packs ($4.74 profit) leading profitability. The U.S. and Ireland drive 96% of sales ($42,335.75), and loyalty cardholders (~43% of transactions) are key. Recommendations include boosting loyalty perks, promoting larger packs, targeting key markets, and preparing for September/October peaks.
